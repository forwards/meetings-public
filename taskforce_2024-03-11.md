# Forwards Taskforce Meeting (AMER-EMEA time)
2024-03-11

Present: Joyce Robbins, Heather Turner, Kevin O'Brien

- HT: Still trying  to fix a time that would suit Aus/NZ (and either AMER or EMEA)

    - will ping people again, probably on Summer break

    - should be the next one in April if we can set a time

## Accessibility

- LH (prior to meeting): I do want to mention concerns about the UseR! Conference. I was asked to provide feedback on the website from an accessibility perspective. I responded about three weeks ago and got no response. I asked Gwynn to pass the info along to people she knew on the committee. People need to know what accessibility practices will be in place before the close of early registration and before the close of abstract submissions.

    - HT raised this again with the organizers.


## Conferences

- useR! abstract submission deadline has been extended to Sunday, 17 March (https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/program/cfp/#overview)

    - The organizers are still keen to get submissions for online talks.


## Teaching

 - Do something local for high school teachers in NYC, e.g. workshop for them to get started using R and enable to use them in lessons.

     - Maybe do as pilot, then potentially be something like the R Packages Workshops that anyone can take materials to teach

 - R Consortium call for grants now open: https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals, April 1 deadline, May 1 notification.
 - Interested people: Mike Chirico (San Francisco), Joyce, Isabella Gollini (Dublin), Zane (Canada East side)

     - HT will send Joyce email with these contacts to consider following up.


 - Joyce willing to re-run R Package Workshop in NYC again (e.g. over two evenings).

     - online one could be done via R-Ladies Remote again

    - Joyce could see if any particular group interested, particularly in countries where may not have such easy access to training

 
 - Ella may be ready to work on Package Development materials again from May ish.
 
## Social Media

 - KO: Tracking engagement on different channels

     - Not getting much from Mastodon

     - Bluesky hasn't worked out so far

     - Twitter impressions have been going down a lot (if you're not paying)

     - Better on LinkedIn

    - Would be good have some more African RUG ones

    - Would be good to have occasional posts from useR! recommended by admin

      - #RStats on instagram quite active as well
      
## Community

- KO: stopped doing RUG organizer meetings as energy levels seem to have gone up again in past 6 months, so less need.
