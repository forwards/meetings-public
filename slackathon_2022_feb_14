### Core team/General

**ACTIONS**
### Accessibility

Zane, Jonathan, and gwynn met to discuss a framework to make ggplot more accessible.

### Community team

DEvelopment of a Francophone online SatRdays in conjunction with R Consortium. I have been in touch with some potential speakers and organizers. As it turns out - Anicet Ebou is planning a SatRdays Abidjan, and the issues arises how to schedule both, with UseR! coming in mid July. 
Ideally the Francophone SatRdays will take place half way between the two. 

useR! is in June 20-23.  RStudioConf is in July.

### Conferences team
useR! 2022
- We now have the complete keynote lineup.
- Yesterday closed the submission of tutorials with 70 proposals.
- Yesterday we announced 25 scholarships (covers registration to the conference and two tutorials) and fee waivers to those who apply.
- All communications are in the 3 "official" languages.
- Adithi and Andrea are now part of the organizing commitee.  Stephen Taiye Balogun also accept being part, I hope we can do the onboarding soon.
- The platform for the conference has not yet been defined.  Liz has given me feedback on other options that are being analyzed.
LH: Is there a process for people with disabilities who might want to submit something (a talk, a tutorial, etc.) but don't know if the conference will be accessible yet? I'm not planning on presenting but if I wanted to, it would be a huge problem. If I proposed something and then couldn't follow through, I'd look really unprofessional.  So basically I have to refrain from submitting when I can't find out before the deadline whether I'll even be able to attend.  

- Today we have the useR! 2022 organize meeting and HopIn was discarded bacause is not screen reader accesible.  The option is The Accelevents. I request they setup a  mini-conference for us to try out.  They say yes. That I can send the emails of people that can try the site to this person from Linux Foundation: dgiles@linuxfoundation.org.

LH: This is great, Yani(?) I would like to ask on the blind R users mailing list for people to come try it out, so please keep me popsted. I appreciate that people oin the committee want to try itry using the screen reader, but it really is different when you can't see the screen at all and have to navigate, as we found out with theLounge.

LH:The fact that this isn't in place means that the accessibility information on the website (largely copied from last year) that promises accessibility is inaccurat (https://user2022.r-project.org/participate/accessibility/)

- You are right.

LH: I also notice a lot of unlabeled links on the UserR! 2022 website.

- I can edit the webpage of useR!, I will try to fix this Liz, thanks so much for let me know this.

**ACTIONS**

LH: Find out who to work with on the website.
