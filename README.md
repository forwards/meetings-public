# meetings-public

This repository is for sharing minutes of Forwards teleconferences (core team meetings, open to all sub-team members to dial-in) and slackathons (virtual asynchronous meetings held on the Forwards slack for all core team and sub-team members). Teleconferences and slackathons are held on alternate months. The minutes are lightly edited to remove confidential information (e.g. related to unannounced R Foundation business, personal information, etc).
