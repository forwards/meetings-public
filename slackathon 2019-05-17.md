## Minutes

### Core team/General
(No items at this time.)

### Community team
- (KO) Forwards assisted the organizers of SatRdays Kampala 2019 in a crowd-sourced fundraising effort. This campaign was very successful, and reached far in excess of the target of 2500 Euro (Although sponsors used the mechanism to transfer funds too, as it avoids bank charges).
    - A notable contribution was made by the Organizers of SatRdays Chicago ( and vicariously SatRdays LA) who contributed a substantial amount of money.
    - This is worth mentioning as it sets a precendent for dispersing excess funds from SatRdays in Europe and North America to those in Africa etc. This will be hugely encouraging for organizers of potential satRdays around the world to know that they will potentially be resourced, and a huge obstacle would be removed. I realize that no two satRdays are alike, and that some European ones may not break even themselves.
- (KO) See #community for thorough description of RUG network: https://rforwards.slack.com/archives/C3WKWBDLG/p1558200742004100

### Conferences team
- (HT) 25 diversity scholarships have been awarded for useR! 2019. We have a couple of good community sessions lined up; in particular one session will have representatives from R4DS, LatinR, AfricaR and satRdays. We will have a Forwards taskforce meeting/workshop on Monday July 8 at the conference venue for those that can make it. We will share coffee and lunch breaks with the Tidyverse Developer Day and some folk plan to hop a bit between the two events. The timing and activities for the Forwards meeting are flexible; please sign up here if you plan to attend: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYzWkjhyPH86SHnMJGyJcx-jBB_vnJ6C_EN7iUx4xpw/edit?usp=sharing.
