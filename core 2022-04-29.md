## Minutes
-- how to get minorities more involved, not burden them, not have them become a token, find out what their needs are, how they can further contribute to Forwards 

-- confidence is a factor and "imposter syndrome" 

- try to avoid having person burning out 



### Core team/General

Lift these voices
- People resigning from RForwards and how to better involve people from marginalized groups
- Disabled in STEM talk at conferences
- Another level or membership in RForwards? Would that have helped Becca?
- Aimee Sue Dunlap - some sort of disability in STEM

- KO: general inertia as a result of pandemic in terms of getting volunteers. But Forwards can act as a resource, e.g. helping with logistics with Namibia R User Group.
- Perhaps we should include another question in the survey "What needs do disabled people in the R community need?"
- Panel at an academic conference to talk about being disabled in STEM
- Video of talks that they've given before, show up and answer questions at the end, e.g. 10 minute talk by Becca: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp4vkK_QaE8&list=PL9LY1bVcxGJd8QhKQYgWd7jtArqrxw7oO&index=17 
- Slackathon May 16 - 19; @charliejhadley & Becca, reach out to MiR, AfricaR, RCDIWG, RLadies, Ben Ortiz-Ulloa, Jacqueline Nolis
- unconf - a few round tables to allow anyone to chip in.
-- Liza Hare : need to clarify what the needs are, find funding for their expertise, low amount of time and high need for funds and recognition of contributions
- clarify tasks that need doing and apply for funding (small grants). E.g. via code for science and society. People can join project vs joining a team.

-- "what do you want to see in R ?"  /
