## Minutes

### Core team/General
Saranjeet Kaur: The project "Building a Community around the R Development Guide" (by Saranjeet Kaur and Heather Turner) got accepted into the Digital Infrastructure Incubator program by Code for Science and Society. This is a 6-month program which started recently (November 2021) with the focus to increase the involvement of community in using the R Dev Guide. The communities that we aim to reach via this program includes R-Ladies, Forwards, MiR, to name a few. We would be conducting "Collaboration Campfires" starting from January 2022 as a part of the Incubator program. The Collaboration Campfires will be 90 minute monthly sessions, that would be very informal and beginner-friendly in nature. Announcements related to the Campfires will be made using the Twitter handle @R_Contributors. We would be focusing on some topics from the R Dev Guide as the agenda for discussion and collaboration during the Campfires.

### Accessibility 
1. Accessibility - accesibility
Dark mode for R
R Journal HTML accessible articles, will likely need some help in the future to check the articles converted from latex/pdf to html, and that alt-text is appropriate. Big tests will come in early January when we deploy the new article format, and web site structure. 
Update package documentation to html files
sweave documents to markdown  - pathway from sweave to html Not sure there is a pathway here, because sweave is pdf, BUT it's mostly scriptable to convert an Rnw document to an Rmd document. 
first success second failure - why? what processes can be put in background



### Community team
Rebooted community teams - Richard and Kevin
Key focus - underserved regions around the world - Africa, APEC - low hanging fruit for the next few months
WhyR with RLadies remote, something similar
Africa R meeting in the new year

### On-ramps team
No updates

### Social media team
Heather updating twitter and website updates

### Surveys
Next Slackathon in Feb to make reproducible summary reports for every year.
Create a template for 2022 to make it easier for next organizer.
Data is incomplete - may not be representative - still want to see how useR attendance has changed over time

### Teaching
Week of Nov 29 - 4 module workshop - 10am NYC time
small group but still able to get through the workshop goals
we'd like to get more people to teach it - Emily and Joyce - Jan 12 and 13 - 1.5 hrs over lunch - 1 hr of teaching 1/2 hr of lab
reach out to other RLadies groups to see if they wold like to teach it
Perhaps run it through the semester
Want to offer it at different times
RPhilly teaches package testing with Shannon Pileggi (%>% hot data)
Maria may test the curriculum in Australia

### Inclusion
Perhaps read - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51075403-nonbinary
Anticipating and dealing with transgender difficulties in a timely way - senior people need to develop a policy - RLadies community slack
Is their a person responsible for slack in case someone shares struggles? Zane is supposed to take over the slack

### Where is the R community?
Meetups in London are done
How will this impact on how we impact our community? 
RLadies is much more active than PyLadies
both groups have suffered from dropoff but more are picking up - Utah, Seattle
RLadies - global team meeting - still growing 40 chapters per year - 
biggest group in LatAM - same number of chapters as USA and Canada - same numbers as USA
pandemic made RLadies stronger - international meetups and sharing burden between chapters
able to be present in new activities
share what has worked in LatAm with more parts of the world
How can we allow more people to participate?
RLadies Melbourne - Christmas dinner in a pub!
RLadies NYC - how do we do meetups now? Companies require vaccine mandates, not meetup policing it
not knowing who will attend makes this difficult
London - deep cleaning after meetups
Tired of online events - meet in person if possible - benefits of online events - maintaining balance is difficult
Takes extra work to have hybrid - having separate host two people in charge - check in with both online and remote people
Same platform for questions - someone reads and chooses questions
RLadies Rio - low attendance pre-pandemic large city and high transportation costs, during pandemic much more reach, local things are much more inclusive


### AOB
- Next Core Team meeting will be 2022-01-14.
