Heather Turner - R Contribution Working Group
- Original goal of Forwards
- First kick off meeting enabled people to speak to issues of diversity, inclusion, and barriers to contributions
- Results: R Dev Guide https://forwards.github.io/rdevguide/ (inspired by Python developer guide) to provide user-friendly introduction to contributions (identifying bug, introducing patch, working with R Core Members on other projects)
- Saranjeet was funded by R Foundation to provide first draft (March-June); presented at useR! 2021
- Hope to get a few more people to read it and get feedback (initial feedback from members of working group)
- useR! has been going since 2004 but never tutorial on how to contribute
- Two at useR! 2021: how to contribute to R general, how to contribute translations (recordings available for both)
- Back in idea generation phase to think about what to work on next year
- Happy to have people propose ideas even if not available to contribute much time to working on it (https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/ideas_incubator.md)
- Comments and questions -- questions on slack (https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/slack), next working group meeting in September
- 

Emma Rand - Teaching Team news: Package dev workshops
- Lecturer in biology department at University of York (computational biologist by training)
- Teaching team colead
- Coincided with COVID -- thought about making workshops more accessible (1-2 day workshops didn't work for everyone due to travel, childcare). How to access more training in bits? Modules are ~1 hour long and trying to specify learning objective and pre-reqs so people can identify what will be most useful for them.
- Still working on -- delivering package workshop again in September (with Mine)
- If interested in helping out, get in touch with Emma or Mine
- Q: Advertised on Forwards twitter?

Liz Hare
- Works on genetics and general statistics -- working dog programs focusing on health and behavior
- Accessibility advisor to forwards; also working with useR! 2021 organizing committee and MiR (Minorities in R)
- Project with Sylvia (last name) looking at use (or lack thereof) of alt text in TidyTuesday submissions -- talk about good things to include in alt text for data visualizations
- Will post talk and slides from GitHub
- (here's the link to the GitHub repo about alt-text: https://github.com/spcanelon/csvConf2021)
- Plan for more educational programming for people interested in data viz for accessbility mostly for low vision and blind people to make visualizations better for people and a bit about alt text
- useR! 2021: Diversity team encompassed accessibility, but worked with organizers across programming. Accessibility: can someone using screen reader use website, are ads on social media accessible and have descriptions for cute marmots (theme of conference), can people get through registration and payment
- Inclusion: how to make people welcome and remove barriers so dont' have to ask us to do so. Ways disability and accessibility are discussed. Bring to community: if apply to give a talk, agree to follow accessibility guidelines (some did, some didn't). 
- Big to have them check off a box of awareness.
- xaringan markdown template for slides to increase likelihood that slides would be more accessible (much more than .pdf and Google slides)
- Hope that people carry forward into their R communities
