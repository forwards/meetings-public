## Minutes

### Core team/General

* Zane has kick-started the process of converting our website to Quarto. Heather, Ella and gwynn are also
  helping with this. Discussion has taken place on the #branding and #social-media channels, but we plan to 
  use the #website channel going forward!
    * It would be great to have some fresh news and blog posts lined up for when we relaunch the website 
      (maybe in 2-3 months time?). We welcome ideas and contributions from anyone on the taskforce - it's 
      a long time since we last put anything out!

### Community team

* Kevin, Ella and Heather attended London satRdays. 
    - Opportunity to meet Tuli Amutenya and Emmanuel Olawale Olamijuwon originally from Namibia and 
      Eswatinit RUGs, now working in UK.
    - Ella and Heather presented about R Contributors, video to appear soon!
* Julia Romanowska asked about RainbowR on RLadies organizer Slack, Heather discussed with Zane and Ella about how to respond
    - Heather has replied: Julia does not have capacity to organize any partnership between the groups, 
      but the offer is there for anyone to pick up.
    - Ella has organised a rainbowR meetup for May 23rd and is planning to spend more time on rainbowR over the summer


### Conferences team

* useR! Regional Events:
    * There are some bridging events planned as there is no useR! the is year. Unfortunately, 
      they provide limited opportunity to get involved, so this is more of a news item for people 
      that happen to be local:
        - R/Basel 2023, Friday 21 July, Basel, Switzerland: https://user-regional-2023.gitlab.io/basel/. 
          Call for abstracts open until Friday 26 May.
        - Friday 21 July, San Francisco, details to follow.
        - Possibly a 3rd event in Shanghai.

### Accessibility
Liz Hare is attending a second BookDash at the Turing Way. I'll be working on planning and filling 
out the new Guide Gor Accessibility. We are also working on accessibility guidelines for collaborative 
events like the BookDash (hackathons can be challenging for people with sensory disabilities).
Also working on equity and inclusion for big team science projects

gwynn attended CSUN in Anaheim, CA and the Day of Accessiblity at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore 
is following up with connections made in both places. She is following up with Dan Gardener from ViewPlus, and other c
onnections including Jenna Gorlewicz and Alex Stefik (the creator of Quorum). She is attending the Quorum conference 
over the summer and is deciding on next steps.
