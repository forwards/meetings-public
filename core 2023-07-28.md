## Minutes

### Core team/General

 - Not much on website lately, but Zane suggested adding RSS to the in-development Quarto site, which is a good idea and something that would be good to add to the site (as we had on the old one).


### Accessibility 

- Jonathan has some accessibility ideas he plans to bring to the R Project Sprint

### Community team

RainbowR meetups are now happening monthly. The last three have been small, only three or four folks at each (though some different people each time) which has led to a lovely, intimate feeling to each meeting, with lots of opportinity for everyone to engage in conversation. Those taking part have said how much they enjoy them and value the group. We've had a few new people in the Slack (now 123 members) as well as more followers on Mastodon (now 354). It does feel a bit like rainbowR is treading water at the moment, though, even though having monthly meetings is an increase in activity over the previous year or so. The monthly meetings keep the group active as well as giving something to post about in Slack/Mastodon, though that's pretty much the extent of activity in those two forums. I have a big to-do list of things I'd like to do to give rainbowR a bit more of a push forward and increase engagement with/in the community, but (as ever) it's a matter of being able to set aside sufficient time to put plans/ideas into action. Zane raised the possibility of opening up a Discord server for rainbowR, but Erin wasn't sure there were enough R users over there to make an active community and I don't know enough about it to have a strong opinion of whether this is worth doing or not.
 - AsiaR are trying out Discord. So far I haven't been able to get it in to it, not sure if it's an issue my end or if the admins aren't familiar enough to set up an invite correctly. On the other hand the discoRd server seem quite active (I think Zane is there already?). In the end it will need a bunch of committed folk to get the community going. Assuming Zane is on discoRd maybe she can ask anyone interested to contact (DM?) her and see what comes back. If there are 3-4 keen folk, maybe it is worth a try.

### Conferences team

- useR! 2024 is live: https://user2024.r-project.org/. If you are interested in being on the organizing/program committee, or you'd like to nominate someone, please fill in this form: https://forms.gle/ZmJj9HJxe8rTvtmV6.
- AfricaR had a idea to work on a virtual conference, but not sure if the idea has got off the ground.

### On-ramps team

- Focus is on the R Project Sprint which is at the end of August. Hoping it will motivate people to get involved both in contributing to R and also encouraging and enabling people from under-represented groups to be part of that.
