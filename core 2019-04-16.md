### Teaching
- (ED) AT&T high school workshop on 4/18 went well -- 13 students worked through first 2 lessons prepared by JR and ED for NYC workshop. Data was updated and JR added a script to do so for future workshops.
- (IG, via slack) Hi! Just to let you know that the workshop in Dublin went very well! All the students were very happy at the end. I've followed the usual set of slides/topics, but I skipped test and version control to leave 1.5 hours in the afternoon to let the students work on their own package. Some of them had already some ideas for the package they wanted to develop, and others used a dataset about music to get ideas (the dataset has been provided by Bruna, one of the amazing teaching assistants!).
- DC has another girls workshop coming up.

**ACTIONS**
- Alternative platforms? Look into dataquest.io.


### AOB
- Next slackathon will be in May.
- Agree that if people can define a task on the issues in GitHub, this is something we can share on Twitter/in R-Ladies groups, etc. to get help on a specific task. Help spread the load!
