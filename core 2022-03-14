### Core team/General

**ACTIONS**

### Accessibility

* (Heather before meeting): Some ideas discussed for Google Season of Docs: https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/issues/5. The idea of converting R Journal articles/vignettes to HTML might end up being an Outreachy/Google Season of Docs project. Yihui might be working on a lighter version of rmarkdown with fewer dependencies.

Accessibility of ggplot add an item to the list that will describe the plots if BrailleR is libraried.

Write email to BrailleR users list to get more blind feedback.
Follow up on meetings with Gary and others
