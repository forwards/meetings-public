## Attendance:

Present: Di Cook, Emily Dodwell, Maria Prokofieva, Pao Corrales, Jonathan Godfrey, gwynn sturdevant

## Minutes

Emily Dodwell
- Former researcher at AT&T Labs; joined Forwards in 2016 while Simon Urbanek was colleague
- Serve as administrator and on teaching team -- previously worked with Joyce Robbins and Ritwik Mitra on high school girls workshop
- Lead organizer of R-Ladies NYC since 2019

gwynn sturdevant
- Writing an article about nonvisual ways of communicating data (includes virtual reality component) -- about lack of accessibility for data
- R is community that really values diversity -- trying to leverage that to centralize technologies into R community
- Di suggestion to gear towards Journal of Computational  Graphical statistics (JCGS); Statistical Analysis and Data Mining (SADM); Journal of Data Science, Statisics and Visualization (JDSSV)
- Some conversation of paper intro and where it could be published -- pitch as opening round of conversation
- Get feedback from people like Susan Vanderplas, Carson Sievert, Barret S, Amanda Cox (nytimes)

Paola Corrales
- From Argentina -- R user since 2014
- Weather scientist -- now doing PhD to predict severe weather forecasts
- Enjoy teaching -- teaching R since last year and developed materials in Spanish (also for climate and weather)
- Now teaching data visualization
- Part of Forwards survey team -- joined last year and worked on Latin America R Users survey
- Trying to organize team to analyze all data from survey -- presented results at useR! 2021 conference, sent proposal to Latin R conference (November)
- Working on how to anonymize the data and open door to help other people work on too
- Also help with useR! conference with some activities -- code of conduct team, diversity and satisfaction survey

Jonathan Godfrey
- Original S+ user during completion of PhD and Minitab (lack of accessibility in latter) -- came to R community, but no other blind people at that time using R (no usable networks for reaching each other), so trial and error
- Figured out screen reading software to best interact with R
- Found email list running out of USA of blind people in USA in mathematics (not as many statisticians)
- First blind person to get a job as lecturer in statistics (no way to find out who was out there to ask questions of)
- Very pleased today that now when people talk about the blind person using R, not just me!
- A research collaboration with Theo and submitted to JSS -- couldn't evaluate findings at the time because no "peers" for review
- Involvement with Forwards started around time of submission to R Journal when met Heather; attended useR! 2014 which started conversations about how blind person would manage
- Opportunities to diversity journal editors (where amount of energy required ...)
- Discussion about social inequality of women still do majority of household/childcare
- What can Forwards try and promote that may have greater chance of longterm benefit, e.g. Google summer of Code (supervising was beneficial -- helps get people to start writing packages)

Di Cook
- Professor at Monash University in Melbourne
- Got involved at Forwards in 2014/2015 when first put together: set up email address, website, brainstormed the name
- Then got involved with editing journals so still lurking
- Would like to keep involved when things lighten up to stay active
- Important for R community to have Forwards organization
- Anything I can help with improving diversity generally, that's a reason to remain involved -- maybe there are things at senior level where I can help make them happen
- Forwards column in R Journal: visibility, communicating to R community with broad visibility
- Involved in survey analysis early on as well -- motivation regularly with useR was measurement of community (based on previous work predicting gender based on name to predict number of packages written by women)
- Extended to consider authorship in other journals -- proportion of community that is female minority -- contentious activity because not appropriate to impose person's gender based on name
- More appropriate thing to do is collect data via surveys, where people can identify preferred gender identity
- As community, don't have good and regular comprehensive measure of how well we are doing in that general R package deliveries and publishing
- Important because factor in getting people promoted
- Surveys are great but nonresponse is an issue for accurately measuring diversity of community

Maria Prokofieva
- At Victoria University in Melbourne
- Been with R community for more than 5 years
- Finance -- working group for R Consortium -- develop packages and create educational materials for business data scientists and accountants
- Promote tools
- Run zoom chats that have been successful
- Task view for auditing and accounting task -- relating all available packages to regular jobs in accounting (huge area for development)
- Trying to incorporate all tools into business analytics classes (despite friction from department)
- Develop workshops
