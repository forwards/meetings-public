### Core team/General

### Community team
rainbowR update: On November 1st, we had a successful rainbowR zoom meet-up/hangout. There were 9 attendees so it was small and that gave it a lovely, intimiate community feel, where everyone had a chance to speak and engage with each other. We ran a show-and-tell (Zane's excellent idea), giving people an opportunity to present, in an informal and safe space, anything R-related they had been working on. There were impressive things to see. I have also set-up a mastodon handle for rainbowR, @rainbowr@tech.lgbt (https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR) though (as of 12:47 on Nov 21st) haven't done anything with it yet other than to include it in the rainbowR twitter account name.

I will use some time during this Slackathon to set up another rainbowR zoom meeting for sometime in the first couple of weeks of December and to build the profile on tech.lgbt and start building and engaging with the community there.

UPDATE (10:24am on Nov 22nd): In less than 24 hours since activating the rainbowR mastodon profile @rainbowr@tech.lgbt, our #introduction toot has been boosted 110 times and favourited 92. Another toot about the #tidyrainbow project so far has 27 boosts and 25 favourites. One community member praised the initiative and is going to think about whether she is able to contribute a couple of data sets. Moreover, the account now has 180 followers and we have six new sign-ups for the Slack group. Not a bad start!

### Conferences team
Liz: I'm on this team but my activities are varied.
- Was elected Assistant DIrector, Data Management & Open Science at the [ManyDogs Project](https://manydogsproject.github.io/)
- Gave an R-specific talk on alt text at R Ladies NY
    - YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXV5bx1WQTM
    - Slide repo: https://lizharedogs.github.io/RLadiesNYAltText/#1
 Participated in The Turing Way BookDash last week. Spent lots of time talking about accessibility both for the book and for the process of making the book. Accessibility was defined in the broad sense-- including things like technical accessibility (bandwidth and hardware requirements) as well as disability-related.∑


### On-ramps team


### Surveys
Andrea: updated the 2022 html results with 1 more answer + joined 2021 surveys into one final file. 
I am aware Daniela is new to the team (hi!). I would love to use this week to show the rest of the team the files and repositories and to step down from this role. I can help with the transition and future teams that will setup the surveys for next editions. Also, I am part of the useR! knowledgebase and will try to document everything about the survey in the dedicated section https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/DEI.html#forwards-survey that is super short right now.
