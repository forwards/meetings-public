- (HT) Some news on the initiative with R Core:
    - We are waiting to hear if Saranjeet was successful in her application for the Tweag fellowship to work on the R Developer Guide. She passed the first round so is in with a chance!
    - We have created an "R-devel" Slack workspace, which you can join here:  https://join.slack.com/t/r-devel/shared_invite/zt-iyb6t1hg-9Qc0_Ky3AKI3JLX2bAvlEA. We are working on a code of conduct for this space, which is open for comment: https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/pull/8. Currently looking for volunteer administrators (a relatively low commitment, see #on-ramps-team for details).
    - We have opened a poll to settle on a name for the group: https://forms.gle/KbLCw4kpSsYYAm1C9.
    - I am hoping to spend some time before the end of the year on a high-level overview of git vs subversion; the ways R Core might be able to expand support for git and what advantages the different options might have. I'd be happy to hear from anyone that is willing to help or offer insight here!
