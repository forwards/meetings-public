Kevin O'Brien is coordinating with various RUGs in Africa to assist with a series of online meetups throughout 2022. WIthin recent weeks, there was 
1.  A meetup co-organized by Botswana R, Eswatini R and Bulawayo R
2. The launch of Namibia R (where Heather Turner gave a presentation)
3. A meetup with Osun R user group
4. A meetup with the Accra R user group Ghana.
Assistance comprises provision of a Zoom Webinar Room, Event Promotion, and - on an ongoing basis - speaker recruitment. The aspiration is to have more speakers from the various countries give talks. 

KOB is also assisting London R revive the live-meetup series. The next London R meetup takes place in Elephant & Castle, South London in late June. (as an aside  - KOB is a former, and still occasional, resident of Southwark)

KOB is assisting Python colleagues in running EuroPython in Dublin. There is a Trans*Code hackathon event taking place at it. Naomi Ceder (formerly the chair of the Python Software Foundation) and Anna-Jayne Metcalf (organizer of the Trans Day Of Remembrance - TDOR) are due to attend.  

R Consortium Working Group on Inclusivity Diversity Equity and Accessibility, chaired by Samantha Toet with the assistance of Joe Rickert, are looking to set up a series of Online SatRdays on an ongoing basis. The first nominated one is a Francophone SatRdays , mostly featuring Speakers from West Africa - with other regions being pencilled in for future events (e.g. Southern Africa). It will probably take 4 or 5 iterations to properly get some momentum going, but this will break in inertia a bit.

### Conferences team

**ACTIONS**
LH: Working on testing screen reader accessibility of the UseR!2022 website/platform/hub. Not much of it is configured yet. I'm encouraged because a lotof the configuration stuff is surprisingly accessible. We'll need to know if the attendee-facing part is accessible, including third party applications like chat and video. I can forward detailed notes for anyone who wants.
Also, we are close to releasing the call for participants for the MiR/CSS #TidyTuesday accessible data visualization event.

Yani: 

Some more notes about useR! 2022: 
- thank Liz for her patience and work on the accessibility aspect.  The biggest problem is that the team in charge of the platform takes a long time to answer because they are going from one conference to another.
- There will be a strong outreach campaign to get more registrations.  At this moment we have 400 registered people.  We will ask you to help us to spread the word to their contacts.
- Some tutorials have already been sold aout.  I will make more diffusion of the tutorials in Spanish that still have places available.
- The results of the diversity scholarships have been sent out.  We were able to award all that were requested.
- The program is now complete, including poster and elevator pitches.
- As always we meet every Thursday.
- We are still working with CZI for money to hire subtitles and translations.
- We are talking with more potential sponsors.

LatinR 2022:
- goes virtual again.  This time there is also a call for tutorials as well as papers and thematic tables as usual. Trilingual like always.
- Dissemination is appreciated.
- We will pay 100 dollars to those who give tutorials.
- We are putting together the team for this year, we want to:
  - Change the web to another format.
  - Create the CoC team. 
- We have a draft about LatinR going virtual to send to the R Journal as a conference report.  I hope we can send this soon.

SSI Software Camp: Paola Corrales and I did a from spreadsheet to R in Spanish! Was the only option in other language than English and was very well received.  Pleople ask for more.

### On-ramps team

* Planning Bug BBQ to fall after useR! 2022
    - Event will be open to all, not just attendees of useR!. It will be free.
    - Tools will be YouTube Video, Zoom breakout rooms and R-Devel Slack. All of these are optional - people could just read the instructions on the web page and work independently.
    - GitHub will be used to record activity, so people will need a GitHub account or will need to team up with some else that can record activity on GitHub.
    - There will be 3 sessions of 4 hours each, people can watch a video to get started: either a long tutorial video, or a short welcome video. Maybe the welcome talk will be live insome sessions, depending on personnel.

**ACTIONS**
 - Create GitHub repo to use during the event
 - Create instructions document so people know what to do during the event
 - Create event page to help advertise the event

### Surveys

* Update on Latin American Survey (led by Pao Corrales and Claudia Huaylla)
 - Team has been meeting every few weeks or so (including others from outside Forwards)
 - Working on blog post(s) for Forwards blog. Hope to have something ready in a few weeks' time
 - Future goals
     - Clean and anonymise data to add to `forwards` R package
     - Modify survey to reach more people, in particular people that don't (yet!) use R.
* useR! survey
 - Need to prepare 2022 survey
     - Will we run satisfaction survey again? Or will organizing team do that?
     - Need to liaise with organizers: How to publicize survey? When? Does anyone on the organizing team want to help?
     - Need to review questions, e.g. missing employment question, check whether questions related to LGBT status should be updated
     - Review report from 2021
