## Minutes

### Core team/General

- Michael Lawrence: organizing some resources for managers in industry who are trying to hire diverse data science / R talent. Motivated by exeperience of hiring in Genentech. Colleague Allison Vuong will be joining On-ramps team and is interested to work on this. Could collate resources, or potentially create job board.
    - Kevin: should try to leverage LinkedIn. R-Ladies groups in particular are starting to use it more. A panel discussion should be a good way to start off. 
    - Michael: is there a list of R-Ladies groups that have a LinkedIn presence?
    - Zane: could be a task for a web scraper, to find jobs. Women who code and DataUmbrella do job aggregation.
    - Michael: ideally would be a way to connect to people from underrepresented groups. Could compile list of orgs like Women who code etc. Create something that multiple companies can use. E.g. resume index.
    - Zane: could use YouTubers to help spread the word.
    - Heather: R-Ladies have been concerned in the past about seeming to endorse companies that may not be good places for people from marginalized groups to work.
    - Michael: learn from other groups
    - Heather: Women in HPC created a resource
 
ACTION:
 - start pooling resources that we know of before December meeting in this file: https://github.com/forwards/Community/blob/master/diversity_hiring.md
     -  YouTube channels:, Discord channels, Slacks 
 - nice to have a "how to pass the interview at company X" being advertised 
 - gather ideas for a panel that we might hold in the spring

### Accessibility 

### Community team

- Rainbow R
   - rainbowR meetup scheduled for November 1st, registration link shared on Twitter (https://twitter.com/R_LGBTQ/status/1582673516830543874?s=20&t=tv_ifRzKVXiwKfWPyKrKew) and Slack (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/viewform?edit_requested=true)
   - https://github.com/r-lgbtq is now an organization (with EK as owner) rather than a 'personal' account through the rlgbtq@gmail.com e-mail address.
   - gglgbtq package now on CRAN, by Laura Bakala, inspired by previous rainbowR zoom meetup - colour palettes based on various pride flags. Blogged about on RainbowR site.

- Kevin has stepped back from Python Ireland so will shortly lose access to the webinar account, which he has been lending to R User Group e.g. in Botswana. May be some potential from R Consortium, but they prefer to work with established RUGs. Potential to upgrade R Foundation/Forwards one next year? Webinars allow better quality recording and also control over who speaks and who can share their screen.

- R Consortium are going to be more stringent on RUGs applying for support: must be active.

- gwynn has been busy with AfricaR, which is being driven forward by Anelda van der Walt. Running a meeting once a month.

ACTION: Heather to look into costs of Zoom webinar account.

### Conferences team

### On-ramps team

### Surveys

### Teaching

- We have not recently ran any workshops or scheduled further ones
- The package development content is still pretty good and we could do a community call to see if others are interested in teaching it within their communities?
     - Possibly suggest to AfricaR
- Zane: I have a repo on how to make a R package, the basics (if interested)  - https://github.com/PythonCoderUnicorn/RpkgGuide

### AOB

- Next Forwards Taskforce EMEA meeting will be 2022-01-27
