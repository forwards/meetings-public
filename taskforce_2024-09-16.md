## 2024-09-16 Taskforce meeting

Present: Zane Dax, Kevin O'Brien, Heather Turner, gwynn gebeyhu
    
* R streams at PyData (notes from Kevin O'Brien)
    - PyData NYC is taking place between Wed 6th November and Friday 8th November in the Microsoft Conference Centre in NYC (42nd and 8th, near Time Square): https://pydata.org/nyc2024. There might an R track on one day if there is enough CFP. They reportedly have a room to spare so can try it out.
    - From R's point of view, it would be great to have a strong showing in a Microsoft hosted conference. It might encourage them to sponsor useR! conferences in the future. (Both KOB and Steven Kell were working with useR!  this year - Steven is now working with PyData NYC)
    - Apropos of the fact that is a PyData Conference - language interoperability (i.e. combining R, Julia and Python) would be perfect.
    - Steven Kell and KOB were discussing PyData Global Conference - an online event in December. We are not sure what NumFocus's plans are for it yet, but I am going to pitch an R track for it. (Assuming the timing suits)
    - General difficulty of getting things running again in person (meetups and conferences), plus general "data science winter", could be good to join again.
    - Contacts in New York: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-newyork/ (https://www.rladiesnyc.org/), also Liz Hare has given talk there and is New York.
    - Potential to link 1-day R events with PyData. Possible way forward as satRdays have petered out (R Consortium became custodian of brand, but have not been proactive in organizing/promoting).

* R on Linkedin (notes from Kevin O'Brien)
    - Essentially a substantial part of the R framework that we knew in the last decade has collapsed.
        * Twitter - absolutely useless even if we do decide to keep using it
        * Meetup Website & RUGs
        * Corporate partnerships (i.e. Sponsors for Confs & Hosts for Meetups)
    - We have to begin anew. Mastodon is fine, but it is intentionally designed in such a way that limits brand development (i.e. Corporate Outreach). LinkedIn is the main play here. 
    - Pages of interest on LinkedIn: 
            - RCollab - A community of R Markdown enthusiasts posting anything related to #RStats, especially #RMarkdown, #QuartoPub and #Bookdown: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/rcollab
            - R User Community: https://uk.linkedin.com/company/r-user-community: more for sharing events
            - Why R? Linkedin page: https://www.linkedin.com/company/why-r/. Propose to reconfigure as a page for technical content: need to find contributors. Promote what R can do to help general perception.
    - Suggestions from Zane re potential Why R? content
        - Showcase highlighting how R can do diverse things, it's cool to use. Maybe 30 second videos of "make a linear regression in X steps" and show the fancy customization. Reach out to science enthusiasts, undergrads.  
        - Make content that talks to Excel users that use pivot tables and show how R is much better, can be automated, Rmarkdown etc. E.g. "do you use pivot tables but want to go to the next level? then R is the answer"
        - YouTube channel that shows how to in R, great channel: https://www.youtube.com/@StatisticsGlobe.
        - Blog by "coolbutuseless" another good example: https://coolbutuseless.github.io
    
* Multilingual webinar Screen Reader Accessible Tools and Resources for Learning and Working with R (announcement from Yanina Bellini Saibene)
    - Tuesday, 10 September 2024 17:00 UTC
    - with rOpenSci’s Champions Alican Cagri Gokcek and Liz Hare
    - Alican Cagri Gokcek organized the webinar in collaboration with Engine Yilmaz from Boğaziçi University (Turkey).
    More info + add to your calendar + link to join: https://ropensci.org/events/rsr-learn-and-use/
* Why R? Slack - repurpose as a R User Community Slack, could be used by conferences
    
* Open Source Community Collider: https://www.opensource.science/updates/inaugural-run-of-the-open-source-community-collider-a-smashing-success - see also #community-team channel on Slack.

    - Next meeting: September 27th at 2pm ET

     - Louis De Silva (Johannesburg), Sayantika Banik


* gg: Would be good to connect African R User Groups, e.g Cameroon (https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2024/09/12/empowering-data-science-how-r-is-transforming-research-in-cameroon)

* WOMBAT conference and OceaniaR hackathon

* Discord R group: discoRd. Invite: https://discord.gg/XvSKfqj5

* ZD: reaching out to people beyond current R users, those who haven't heard of R.
