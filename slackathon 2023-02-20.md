### Core team/General

* Does anyone need help with anything? Let us know on the #general channel
* (HT): Does anyone have any news from the last 6 months? I'll be writing an update for the R Journal this week.
* (HT) We now have a Mastodon account: https://hachyderm.io/@R_Forwards - please follow! I've tried to find everyone here to follow, if I've missed anyone, please let me know on the #soical-media channel.

### Accessibility

An article about accessibility was published in the AmStat news: https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2023/01/02/jedi-corner-sensification/

### Community team
- (EK) There was a rainbowR meetup on January 24th. Unfortunately, Ella was unable to host at the last minute but thankfully Heather was able to start the meeting and Zane host. Apparently, it went well.

I propose the next rainbowR zoom meetup for the afternoon of April 26th. That said, there is also a possibility of trying to schedule something in person in London, perhaps as part of a broader Forwards meetup on Friday April 21st, to tie in with the SatRday conference the following day. If that does happen, we'd probably hold the next online meetup at the end of May, rather than April.

### Conferences team

### On-ramps team
* (HT) Help wanted with Spanish translation - a minor update to the README of the R Contribution repo. Please see #on-ramps if you can help!
* (HT) Ella Kaye and I will be giving a talk about our work with the R Contribution Working Group at London satRdays.
