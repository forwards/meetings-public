## Minutes

### Core team/General
- HW had 300 Forwards hex stickers printed for us! ED and JR will distribute some at next teaching workshop for girls.

**ACTIONS**
- Do keep us up-to-date on conferences, etc., that you plan to attend so hopefully we can distribute in person (ALL)
- See item under On-ramps team Actions (below)

### Community team
- (See thread in #community channel on Slack.)


### Conferences team
(No items at this time.)


### On-ramps team

- (HT) Hacktoberfest ideas:
    1. Publish the (first?) blog post on collaborative coding (c.f https://github.com/forwards/tasks/issues/26). 
    2. Liaise with rOpenSci to get them to promote `good-first-issue` as a tag, [as promoted by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-labels/), vs `beginner` as [used last year.](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/02/hacktoberfest/) MS opened an [issue](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide/issues/84) to update their dev guide.
    3. See if we can label any of our own issues as Hacktoberfest issues and promote on Twitter.
    4. Re-tweet/discuss on Facebook about Hacktoberfest opportunities related to R, e.g. rOpenSci post, R-Ladies Hacktoberfest hackathons. Call from rOpensci to label issues has been re-tweeted; keep eye out for more.

**ACTIONS**
- Work on blog post (CW, AR)
- Review issues to see if we can promote as Hacktoberfest issues (HT,and Core Team)


### Social media team

**ACTIONS**

### Surveys
(No items at this time.)

**ACTIONS**
- Analyze the useR! 2018 survey data.


### Teaching
- IG will be giving a hort version of the package workshop at the [Datafest in Tbilisi](https://datafest.ge/) (and maybe also in Dublin with R-Ladies).
    - (HT) Feel free to use my satRdays slides for the content, which was basically a selection from the full day course and is about 2 hours of material. I would probably skip/simplify the bit about how packages get into memory, it's a bit too much detail at that stage.  They are in ppt, so you could try using the slidex package to convert to xaringan as mentioned in this [Github issue](https://github.com/forwards/tasks/issues/16).
- IG has material for a beginner R workshop she gave at the Diversity in Data Workshop here in Dublin. Can be shared on GitHub with addition of CC BY-NC 4.0 license.
- HT has a half-day R programming workshop where I have made an effort to include "stepping stones" to package development, e.g. documenting and testing functions. She'll see how it goes, but can probably share that afterwards, so we have a sequence from R starter to R developer workshops.
- Priority for distribution of Forwards hex stickers is priority is workshop participants, diversity scholars and members of Forwards.

**ACTIONS**
- Convert workshop slides into xarigan; use [Earo's slides](https://github.com/earowang/rladies-pkg) as a starting point (IG, NT)
- Get Forwards hex stickers to Nor'eastR conference to a) to hand out there, b) to pass some (the rest?) on to DS who would be a good distributor as he goes to many R conferences!
- Get Forwards hex stickers to DC somehow for girls workshop in Brisbane in November (ED mail them?)
