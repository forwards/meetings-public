## Minutes

### Core team/General

- (HT) To all affected by the spread of COVID-19, keep safe and feel free to take a break.
- (HT) KO and I will be moderating breakout sessions during [satRday DC](http://dc2020.netlify.com/), which is going to be all online. Maybe see some of you there!
- In the future, with two weeks notice, DScott can organize someone from MiR to run a breakout group.
- (HT) Ben Ortiz Ulloa has the idea to use the Zoom license that has been covered by satRday DC sponsorship (up to 500 attendees) to put on a remote data science conference for the Rainbow R community (Rainbow Data?). I've suggested he contact NT, DCerasuolo and DSmith after the satRday to follow-up, let me know if you would also like to be involved. Discussion in #conferences.
- MiR may also be able to use to run an event.
- License is available for 3 months.

### Community team
- (KO): DC Remote satRday went well. In the first instance of the Global Room, the concept evolved into "virtual speed networking"  very quickly, which went very well. For something like that, a critical mass is needed; we had about 10 people, which was ok for one or two twenty minute sessions, but it eventually runs out of steam.
- (HT): 8-12 folks in each R-Ladies breakout session. People tended to stay muted with video off unless they knew someone, so it's a bit hard to know what people thought of it. We did try to open up the conversation and one or two people did join in or ask a question. In one session, there was a bit more activity on the text chat where we shared resources.
