## Minutes

### Core team/General
- KO: [Interesting read](http://theconversation.com/the-mental-health-pros-and-cons-of-minority-spaces-in-the-workplace-107554?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1547221246)


### Community team

- Discussing R in Africa on #community:
    - KO: Committee formation to develop African analogue of RLadies (essentially a RUG with significant R Ladies Global involvement) with interest in geographic spread
    - KO: Company structure may be required for conference organization capacity
    - KO: Good governance structure via an auditor (external, power to dissolve committee if necessary), which is a vestage of RUGs network
    - HT: Due to restrictive LGBT rights in African countries, in the short term it's better to have R summits by region organized by local entities vs. a global event (e.g. useR! organised in Africa) because citizens can't help the laws of where they live, but we do have the choice for a global event.

### Surveys
(No items at this time)


### Teaching
- AL: It would be valuable to collect (anonymized) information via pre/post-workshop surveys sent out to Forwards attendees as a way of assessing impact/reporting outcomes, especially in light of being able to report on outcomes for the R Consortium grant.
    - HT: It does need a bit of pre-planning to get permission to use people's email for a follow up survey. If you plan to do this for your Chicago workshop, please note Forwards [privacy policy](https://forwards.github.io/docs/privacy_policy/). We could create a new private repo for teaching team surveys.
    - HT: I've added a private repo named teaching_surveys and given the teaching team write access (core team members have admin access).
    - AL: Here’s the [Software Carpentry repo](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment) with a list of questions they use for learner assessment — perhaps we could design a shorter version for Forwards?
- ED: AT&T is hosting a Youth Technology day in late March/early April, and I'm in discussions with the organizer to run a co-current session for ~15 high school students based on the workshop JR and I ran. I believe there will be a mix of girls and boys, but materials would be credited to Forwards and as the instructor, I'll be a representative.
    - HT: As the materials are CC-BY anyone can use them with credit, but for outreach to underrepresented groups, I'm happy for such things to be called a joint event with Forwards or to use the Forwards logo/name in promotion etc. 
- AL: I was thinking about planning another USA-based women’s package workshop on the East Coast with Sam Toet in the summer, in Charlottesville, VA.
    - The idea would be to do a second Forwards workshop for individuals located on the East Coast/Mid-Atlantic — I’ll have experience running a workshop, and can help Sam with infrastructure, and she has lots of experience teaching workshops with R-Ladies Charlottesville. Then maybe she can co-teach a Forwards workshop with some other R-Lady!
- Publicizing next workshop in Chicago and discussing follow-up questionnaire on #teaching

**ACTIONS**
- Add Youth Technology Day to Edu page as record of Forwards-related workshop/training (ED)
